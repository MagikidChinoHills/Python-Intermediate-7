Problem 1: Move Multiple Shapes (Create a Tkinter application that moves two rectangles across the canvas)
- Create a canvas widget.
- Create two rectangles with different colors and sizes.
- Move the rectangles in different directions: one moves right, and the other moves left.
- Use the after method to continuously move the rectangles.

Problem 2: Bouncing Ball
- Create a canvas widget.
- Draw a circle (ball) on the canvas.
- Make the ball move diagonally.
- If the ball hits any edge of the canvas, reverse its direction (so it "bounces").

Problem 3: Color Changing Rectangle
- Create a canvas widget.
- Draw one rectangle.
- Add a button labeled "Change Color" below the canvas.
- Each time the button is clicked, the rectangle changes to a random color.
